  Gatsby p5.js Starter
</h1>

This is ‚úè ***WIP*** a Gatsby starter that integrates with p5.js. View a live version of it at https://gatsby-p5-gallery-starter.herokuapp.com/

## TODO
- [ ] Add instructions on adding your own p5.js sketch

## ‚ú® Features
- [gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)
- responsive css-grid gallery with [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
- React integration for [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) sketches. Note that this does not use `react-p5-wrapper` -- no need.
- [Typography.js](http://kyleamathews.github.io/typography.js/)

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 0. Make sure you have the basics.

- ***Node.js***
In order to use this template, you need to have node.js installed. Run `node -v` on the command line, and if a version is displayed, you're good to go. If not, check out Gatsby's instructions on the [**appropriate installation**](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-zero/#install-nodejs-for-your-appropriate-operating-system) for your machine.

- ***Git***
You need Git in order to use Gatsby. If you don't have Git, get it using [**these instructions**](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-zero/#install-git).

- ***Gatsby CLI***
You'll need to install this node.js package globally, with `sudo npm install -g gatsby-cli`. Enter your password when prompted. Once it's finished installing, view the available commands by running `gatsby --help`.

*NOTE!* 
If you already have gatsby-cli, and you're seeing an error related to a missing dependency called `ink`, you need to update your gatsby-cli by running `npm update gatsby`. More information on this issue can be found [here](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/22109).

### 1. Create a Gatsby site.

*Don't just clone this repo.* 

Instead, use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the starter project.

```sh
gatsby new <your-project-name> https://github.com/doubledherin/gatsby-p5-starter.git
```

This will create a new Gatsby project based on a clone of this repo.

### 2. üî• Fire it up!
`cd` into the new project directory that was created, then run
```sh
gatsby develop
```

Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

_Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is GraphiQL, a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

Notice that you also have hot reloading out of the box: make an edit to `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time.

üî• Hot reloading is hot hot hot. üî•

### 3. Set up your Github repo.

Create a new repository on Github and then add it as the origin remote locally with 

```sh
git remote add origin <url-of-your-github-repo>
```

Push your local `master` branch to the remote:

```sh
git push origin master
```

## Customizations

### Typography
This starter uses [Typography.js](http://kyleamathews.github.io/typography.js/) with the Bootstrap theme. To choose a different theme or to customize your own theme, follow [these Typography.js docs](http://kyleamathews.github.io/typography.js/) or these [Gatsy-Typography ones](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/typography-js/).

### Landing Page
TO DO

### Gallery Page
The images in the Gallery are automatically optimized for fluid responsive rendering using the `gatsby-image`, `gatsby-plugin-sharp`, and `gatsby-transformer-sharp`. They are dynamically rendered via GraphQL queries enabled by the `gatsby-source-filesystem` plugin.

Any image in `src/images/gallery` will appear on the Gallery page, and the text for the image is based on the filename. So if you want the text for your image to be "P5 Is Awesome", the filename of the image needs to be `p5-is-awesome.<file extension>`.

Clicking on any image in the gallery will redirect you to a page with a full-screen representation of the gallery item. The pages for each gallery item are generated dynamically in the gatsby-node.js config file. For more information on how this works, see the [Gatsby tutorial of programatically creating pages](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-seven/).

## üí´ Deployment
This starter has instructions on deployment to Heroku, but if you're interested in hosting your  site somewhere else, there are plenty of options; check out the [**Gatsby docs**](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/deploying-and-hosting/).

1. If you don't already have a Heroku account, create one for free [here](https://signup.heroku.com/).
2. Make sure you're logged in and go to your dashboard, at https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps.
3. In the top right corner, click "New", then "Create New App".
4. Enter a name for your app and choose a region. Unless you need it (unlikely) ignore the 'Add to pipeline' option.
5. If you don't have it already, download and install the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli). If you're not sure, type `heroku -v` on the command line. If a version is printed to the terminal, you have the Heroku CLI. If not, you don't.
6. Once you have the Heroku CLI, you should be able to log in to Heroku on the command line. Do that by running `heroku login`
7. Add a heroku remote for your app `heroku git:remote -a <your-heroku-app-name>`
7. Set the heroku/node.js and heroku-buildpack-static buildpacks on your application: Run `heroku buildpacks:set heroku/nodejs` and then `heroku buildpacks:add https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-static.git`. There is already a static.json file in your repo. Heroku will automatically detect and run the build script from your package.json.
8. Heroku can only deploy from the master branch. Run `git push heroku master` to deploy what's on your local `master` branch; run `git push heroku <local-branch-name>:master` to deploy what's on your local branch. 

Once it completes, your app should be deployed to your-app-name.herokuapp.com. 

Heroku will automatically detect and run the build script from your package.json

That should be all you need, but more information on deploying to Heroku can be found [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/deploying-to-heroku/.)

## üéì Learning Gatsby

Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives [on the website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Here are some places to start:

- **For most developers, we recommend starting with our [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

- **To dive straight into code samples, head [to our documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).** In particular, check out the _Guides_, _API Reference_, and _Advanced Tutorials_ sections in the sidebar.
